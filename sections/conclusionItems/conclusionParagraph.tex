CI-CD on cloud tool is used for the betterment of the development, testing and deployment process. The main concern of this kind of tools is to reduce the overhead and stress from the team members. This cloud application is also making the release process mor inclined through automation steps. Software can be released with minimal effort by this. Risk of introducing bugs comes down a lot. Speeds up the releasing software steps as well. Rollback to the previous stable software version is also a click way for the teams. No need to notify user or take their precious times to deploy te product on their environment and make neccessarry changes in the environment as well. It is still rather a new topic in the software development process. And we hope it will be recognised by more in coming days in software release.
